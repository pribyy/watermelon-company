# Write down how git works

Fundamentally there are a few phases:

- Stage
- Commit
- Push
- Pull

git add, commit, pull, push, status, branch, checkout, reset.

## In the staging phase, you want to decide what to add as a `commit`.

So in this phase.. you're deciding what to bundle together to "commit/save".

You can use VSCode's Git integration's plus button, or you can type `git add <filepath>`

### You can check the status of your staging (what is staged? how do you find out?)

By typing `git status` OR, just seeing what is in the "Staged changed" section on VSCode git integration.
